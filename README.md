If you're feeling special, cloning this repository is also an option.

## Name Tables

You can use these tables to help determine which files correspond to which cards. Pick a color and a suit, join
the corresponding codes, and find the file whose name matches the result (e.g. the code for the color Blue is B and
the code for the suit Reverse is R, so the file for Blue Reverse is `BR.png`.)

For Wild, Wild +4, and Blank, refer to the "Special Cases" table.
